        <h2>Weight Lifting <span>Training</span></h2>
        <p>Weight lifting is an effective way to build muscle, increase strength, and improve overall health. Whether you're new to weightlifting or looking to refine your technique, understanding key principles can help you get the most out of your workouts.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of Weight Lifting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Builds Muscle Mass:</strong> Weight lifting helps stimulate muscle growth by challenging your muscles with resistance.</li>
            <li><strong>Increases Strength:</strong> Over time, lifting weights increases your physical strength and endurance.</li>
            <li><strong>Boosts Metabolism:</strong> Increased muscle mass leads to a higher basal metabolic rate (BMR), meaning you burn more calories at rest.</li>
            <li><strong>Improves Bone Density:</strong> Weight-bearing exercises help strengthen bones and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhances Mental Toughness:</strong> Regular weight lifting can boost confidence and mental resilience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Principles of Weight Lifting</h3>

        <h4>1. Proper Form</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Form is critical to avoid injury. Always prioritize form over the amount of weight you lift.</li>
            <li>Use controlled movements and don’t rush through your sets. A slow, steady movement increases muscle engagement and minimizes the risk of strain.</li>
            <li>For compound movements like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses, ensure your back remains straight and your knees stay aligned with your feet.</li>
            <li>Don’t lock your joints at the top of lifts; maintain a slight bend to protect your joints.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Progressive Overload</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gradual Increase:</strong> The principle of progressive overload involves gradually increasing the weight, number of sets, or reps to continue challenging your muscles.</li>
            <li><strong>Intensity:</strong> Aim to increase intensity by adding small increments to the weight or adding more sets to push your limits and promote muscle growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking Progress:</strong> Keep a workout journal to track the weight, reps, and sets to ensure you’re progressively increasing the challenge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Rest and Recovery</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Muscles grow during rest periods, not during the workout itself. Ensure you allow enough recovery time between sessions.</li>
            <li>Aim for 48 hours between working the same muscle group to prevent overtraining and promote muscle growth.</li>
            <li>Consider doing light cardio or stretching on rest days to promote circulation and help with muscle recovery.</li>
            <li>Sleep is essential; aim for 7-9 hours per night to support muscle repair and overall health.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. Nutrition for Strength</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Consume a protein-rich diet to support muscle repair and growth. A general guideline is to consume around 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.</li>
            <li><strong>Caloric Surplus:</strong> If your goal is to build muscle mass, you may need to eat in a slight caloric surplus, meaning consuming more calories than you burn.</li>
            <li><strong>Carbs and Fats:</strong> Carbohydrates provide energy for workouts, and healthy fats help with hormone production. Both are essential for recovery and muscle growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Staying hydrated helps with muscle function and performance during your workout. Aim to drink water before, during, and after your training session.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>5. Weight Lifting Routine Examples</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Full-Body Routine:</strong> Perform compound movements like squats, deadlifts, bench press, rows, and overhead press. Aim for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps for each exercise.</li>
            <li><strong>Upper-Lower Split:</strong> Focus on upper body exercises (chest, back, shoulders, arms) one day and lower body exercises (legs, glutes) the next. Rest and repeat.</li>
            <li><strong>Push-Pull-Legs Split:</strong> Divide workouts into pushing movements (chest, shoulders, triceps), pulling movements (back, biceps), and leg exercises. Do this 3-6 times per week depending on your experience level.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Weight Lifting Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not Warming Up:</strong> Skipping a warm-up can increase the risk of injury. Always take time to prepare your muscles with light cardio and dynamic stretching.</li>
            <li><strong>Overtraining:</strong> Lifting too frequently or without proper recovery can lead to burnout or injury. Make sure to balance your lifting days with rest days.</li>
            <li><strong>Neglecting Lower Body:</strong> Many beginners focus more on upper body lifting, but it’s essential to work your lower body as well to achieve a balanced physique and build strength.</li>
            <li><strong>Using Too Much Weight:</strong> Lifting too heavy without the necessary form can cause injury. Start with manageable weights and focus on technique.</li>
        </ul>
